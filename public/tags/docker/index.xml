      <description>DockerCon 2018 - great event (with a small fly in the ointment) I have just returned from DockerCon Europe 2018 and Iâ€™d like to share my impressions while they are fresh in my mind. It was my first DockerCon so I was not quite sure what to expect. As the title says, it was great experience and barring the scaling issue (more below) could have been really awesome experience.</description>
