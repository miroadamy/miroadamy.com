<p>A wonderful gem I found <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000328.html" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I remember telling a friend<br />
that being a project manager<br />
is a little like being a bouncer:<br />
where there's a problem *here*<br />
and a door *there*<br />
and it's your job to get the problem out the door.</p>
<p>So<br />
For some a gentle gesture will do<br />
while others need a push<br />
and still others need to be picked up by their pants and carried</p>
<p>But!<br />
In no case should you ever let someone get *further* from the door.<br />
So that's me.</p></blockquote>

<p>I dedicate this to all my friends and colleagues who face daily the Project Management challenges, specially to Peter, Julia, Mike and Milos.</p>
