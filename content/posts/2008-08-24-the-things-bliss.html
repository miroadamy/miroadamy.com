<p>Finally - the new version of <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/iphone/" target="_blank">Things</a> on iPhone can synchronize with <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/" target="_blank">Things</a> on Mac desktop.</p>
<p>It actually works - no strings attached. Assumed that:</p>
<p>1) the WiFi on iPhone is on</p>
<p>2) iPhone and Mac are on same network (so that Bonjour magic can work)</p>
<p>3) the Mac Things is running when you start Things on iPhone</p>
<p>the synchronization happens automatically and is VERY fast (few seconds max).</p>
<p>Finally a portable GTD application that works for me :-).</p>
<p>PS: Things is very nice implementation of GTD. If you are not into GTD cult, do not bother - or try reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">this</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://www.43folders.com/" target="_blank">this</a> first ....</p>
