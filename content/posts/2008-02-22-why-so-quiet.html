<p>I have been sick for last two weeks, most of the time offline, listening to podcasts and audiobooks and doing more or less nothing. I have caught up with the backlog of episodes, saw lots of videos from Macworld.</p>
<p>Among the audiobooks I was listening two, some recommendations:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Company-Max-Barry/dp/140015202X/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1203738098&amp;sr=1-8" target="_blank">The Company</a> is good parody of the corporate life. Starting with missing donut, it tells the story of a new hire in large corporation, governed by strange rules. It soon has an interesting twist - find for yourself.  The book is available as MP3 CD, so you can save time ripping it to iPod.</p>
<p>Another book that I liked was cult classic that I have read before (in at least 3 languages), but never heard it: <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Dune-22-CDs-Frank-Herbert/dp/1427201439/ref=sr_1_23?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1203738219&amp;sr=1-23" target="_blank">The Dune</a>. Nicely done, and an excellent way how to make time fly faster when you are locked to bed and too sick to do any serious reading or coding :-)</p>
<p>As of yesterday, I am back in circulation, trying to catch up with everything I missed for last two weeks.</p>
