<p>After carrying in my pocket for 3 days, I have decided to get something to prevent my smallest Mac from scratches and breaking when drops (I did drop the iPod touch and it was close call: one of the edges was scratched and slightly damaged).</p>

<p>Recommended.</p>
<p>I bought it in one of the two <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/retail/saintecatherine/" target="_blank">Montreal Apple Store</a> for $24.95</p>
