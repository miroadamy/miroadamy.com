One of the Microsoft old-timer bilionaries, Charles Simonyi, Hungarian born software engineer, famous for his `Hungarian naming notation` - who would not remember `lpstrzDescription` or `wFlag` - is visiting Valencia on his yacht Skat.

Those who do not write code (or better said - did not write code 20 years ago) may be familiar with his other contribution - Microsoft Word, something I feel much less positive about than `lpstrzDescription`.

He is also 2x space tourist - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simonyi
