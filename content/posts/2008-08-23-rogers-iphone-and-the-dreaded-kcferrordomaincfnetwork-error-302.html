<p>Many people recently (including myself) had experiences difficulties with Web access on the iPhone. Quite often the following error message pops up:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-519" src="/images/img_00022.png" alt="" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>Usually repeating the web page access helps. Sometimes you have to try third time or wait few minutes.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with signal strenght - as you can see, there are 4 bars and 3G is on. I saw it happen on Edge as well. Reseting the phone sometimes helps, but it is hard to say whether because of the reset or time delay ..</p>
<p>Most people think this is network problem with Rogers data network and I tend to agree. If it was an iPhone or Safari issue, it would not go away with retrying - I think.</p>
<p>It also happens in more than just Safari: the weather does not get updates, Mail fails  fetching the last state and so on.</p>
<p>Here are some threads on the issue:</p>

<p>It would not be first time when Rogers would be using paying customers as beta testers of the service. Few years back when hispeed internet was introduced, I remember frequent outages and spending time with their (not so great) techsupport. Eventually, they must have learned how to do it or build up capacities because it went away.</p>
<p>Let's hope the same happens with the 3G data network. And it better happens quickly, because this service sucks, dear Rogers ...</p>
<p>If you are seeing the same issue, please open the ticket with both Rogers and Apple (to create some pressure).</p>
