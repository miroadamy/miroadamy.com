<p>With latest iTunes update, quite silently, a very nice new feature appeared. Apple started to offer for download lectures from many universities, with wide selection of topics: from environment through politics to mathematics and computer science. Most of the lectures are videos, but you will find also audio tracks - albeit for some topics, audio is quite problematic. Can you imagine doing e.g. differential equations in audio-only ?</p>
<p>The best feature - the lectures are free downloads. See more details <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/itunesu/" target="_blank">here</a> or on iTunes.</p>
<p>I guess now I do have really compelling reason to buy a video iPod :-)</p>
