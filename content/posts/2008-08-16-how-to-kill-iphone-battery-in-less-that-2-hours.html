<p>This may be a random event, but here is what happened:</p>
<p>1) Switch on camera and and take couple of pictures</p>
<p>2) While camera still on in taking pictures mode, switch off the phone (by the switch on top).</p>
<p>After doing that, about 1.5 hour later I took out the phone to check the emails. Phone was very warm - not the kind of unpleasantly hot you get from Macbook Pro battery when rendering movie on batery power , but still much warmer than ever. Camera was still  on. The battery that was two hours ago fully charged  was on less than 10%.  Strange.</p>
<p>Anybody else had similar experience ?</p>
<p>Since that, of course I am careful to switch off the camera first. I think that time is almost ready for 2.1 firmware with the core apps updates, how about that Apple ?</p>
