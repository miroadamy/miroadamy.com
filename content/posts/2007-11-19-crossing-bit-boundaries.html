<p>Today is a special day for this blog as two bit boundaries were crossed. This is post number 256, which means that I have used all 8 bit numbers for numbering and jumped into nine bit space. The byte is not enough any more - vive la 0x100.</p>
<p>Another boundary crossed today is number of hits as tracked by Wordpress (which does not count my visits). In this case the number reached and crossed was 0x8000 or 32768 decimal, which brings us to upper half of the 16 bit address space. From today, full 16 bit counter must be used - and it must be even "unsigned short int" :-).</p>
<p>Not much blogging during weekend as I am still catching up with my de-cluttering project, enforced on me by the renovation - both in digital and physical  world. The goal is to reduce number of physical computers in my office by three - to four from 7. It is unbelievable how much time it takes to clean up 4 year old Windows installation, remove all the junk and back-up what needs to be preserved. For every removed physical machine, at least one virtual is created, therefore the absolute number of used IP's actually grows ...</p>
<p>So far, I managed to get rid of old desktop (AMD Athlon 1800, 1 GB RAM, 2x120 GB HDD), even much older desktop running Win2000 used as Oracle DB server (P-III Celeron 400 MHz, 384 MB RAM, 40 GB HDD) and last one to clean up is another P-III - former Linux Samba Server (120 GB HDD, 512 MB RAM if I am not mistaken). I have tried out the VMWare convertor and created 10 GB virtual machines from both desktop and Oracle server using VMWare importer It is amazing how much faster the virtual machine runs on a Macbook Pro than it did on old hardware.</p>
<p>Oh btw, if you are in Ottawa and want two old P3 machines absolutely free for any charity or other worthy purpose, email me at firstname dot lastname at gmail. Machines are in good working condition - but without Windows. If it is for charity or school or something similar, I am willing even to help putting on a Linux distribution and deliver them to your place - if it is in reasonable distance between downtown and Kanata. The only quite fast machine - Athlon - is already gone, my son grabbed it to build some sort of digital TV recorder using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV" target="_blank">Myth-TV</a>. I do not watch TV, but I am quite curious how it will work.</p>
