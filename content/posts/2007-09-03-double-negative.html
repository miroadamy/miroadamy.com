<p><em> A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day.  "In<br />
English," he said, "A double negative forms a positive.  In some<br />
languages, though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a<br />
negative.  However, there is no language wherein a double<br />
positive can form a negative." </em></p>
<p><em>A voice from the back of the room piped up, "Yeah, right."</em></p>
<p>Found on the Net :-)</p>
