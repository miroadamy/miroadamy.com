<p>This is what I got trying to track my recent purchase from Apple Store ...</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-459" src="/images/picture-22.png?w=300" alt=""  /></p>
<p>That may not be the most useless error message ever seen on Web but it comes pretty close ... One would expect a bit more professional treatment from such big company ...</p>
<p>Why does a company that puts so much emphasis on user experience and perception (like Apple) pick business partners (such as <a href="http://www.purolator.com/" target="_blank">this one</a> - or one certain Canadian wireless provider company running the GSM network) that suck so much that it ruins this perception ? Are the other companies even worse ? Hard to imagine ...</p>
