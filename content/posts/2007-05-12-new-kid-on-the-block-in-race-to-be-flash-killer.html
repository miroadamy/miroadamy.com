<p>After Adobe's <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo">Apollo</a> and Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/default01.aspx" target="_blank">Silverlight</a>, Sun has addes own version of scriptable, interactive platform named <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javafx/index.jsp" target="_blank">JavaFX</a>. Unlike the previous three (Flash included), this is going to be Open Sourced - under the Microsoft's most hated license - GPL.</p>
<p>Now the race to replace Flash  really becomes  really interesting ...</p>
