<p>Another important step forward for all who are looking for alternatives  to replace Outlook. With latest Thunderbird 2.0rc1 release it is now possible to add calendaring capability to Thunderbird (using the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/" target="_blank">Lightning</a> add-on) with Google calendar synchronization that works even with iCal invitations :-). Really nice.</p>
<p>The author's blog at <a href="http://bfish.xaedalus.net/?p=239" target="_blank">http://bfish.xaedalus.net/?p=239</a> seems to be down, but cached version <a href="http://duggmirror.com/software/Stay_in_Sync_with_GCal_and_Thunderbird/" target="_blank">is available</a>.</p>
<p>Credits and thanks to Joel for finding it.</p>
