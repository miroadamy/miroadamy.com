After I created the ThinkWrap GitHub account and uploaded the public key, this key got somehow bound to GitHub identity 'madamy'

I had to add user madamy to my public GitHub repo - where I keep the dot-files - <https://github.com/radegast/dotvim>

This may be an issue for people that have their own private accounts - the key management is the key.

## Alternative

Use https for forking , instead read/write ssh. No keys involved there
