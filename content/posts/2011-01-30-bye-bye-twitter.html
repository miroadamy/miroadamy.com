<p>I have came to a conclusion that I do have too much <em>stuff</em> in my life.</p>
<p>Too much and too little and the same time.</p>
<p>Too much information. Too many interruptions and distractions. Too little time to think.</p>
<p>Too much consumption of information and not enough time to process it and do anything meaningful with it - learn from it or create something new.</p>
<p>The only way how to get out of the self-digged hole is to start cutting.</p>
<p>One of the big sources of distraction and cause of many pointless hours spent on Web is Twitter.</p>
<p>I was using Twitter mostly as filter: by following people with similar interest, trying to curate the content "out there".</p>
<p>It worked to a certain degree - and I indeed discovered some interesting pieces of information I would miss otherwise.</p>
<p>The real questions I have to ask are: did these discoveries justify the time spent reading through pointless tweets (big portion of twittersphere) ? The answer is no. What would I miss by not finding them ? The answer is - not much, really. What difference did not missing them make in the<br />
long run ? And the final answer is None.</p>
<p>It is very hard to say something that matters in 160 characters. Some people can do it, I am not one ofÂ  them.</p>
<p>So after few years of being on Twitter I am deleting my Twitter account today.</p>
<p>Bye bye Twitter. I will try not to miss you. And I am sure you will not miss me.</p>
