<p>A friend made me aware of this (thanks, Peter):</p>
<p>The Inside Deets on iPhone 2.0.2 and Dropped Calls<br />
<a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2008/08/28/the-inside-deets-on-iphone-202-and-dropped-calls/" target="_blank">http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2008/08/28/the-inside-deets-on-iphone-202-and-dropped-calls/</a></p>
<p>Sounds like plausible explanation.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not the network that is fault but the interaction of the bad<br />
power control algorithm in 2.0 and 2.0.1 software and the network that<br />
is at fault. The sooner everybody is running 2.0.2 software the better<br />
things will be. Having seen the graphs the 2.0.2 software has already<br />
started to make difference.</p>
