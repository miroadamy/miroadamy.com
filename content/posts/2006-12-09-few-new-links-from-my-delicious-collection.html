<p>According Forrester reseach <a href="http://www.forrester.com/ER/Marketing/0,1503,214,00.html"> ".. the Web will fade. It will be replaced by a new software paradigm"</a>. Nobody knows what this new paradigm will be, but <a href="http://www.ektasis.com/products/index.html">these guys</a> are saying that it will be their platform. I found this link from this very interesting two part article <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/changing_climates_microsoft_google.php" class="permalink" rel="bookmark" title="Changing Climates for Microsoft and Google, Desktops and Webs">Changing Climates for Microsoft and Google, Desktops and Webs</a><span class="permalink"> making interesting analogy between Google and AOL business model, browser as a platform and possible return of thick client ("smart client" in Microsoft terms), why Google might want to buy Adobe and many other interesting observations. Worth reading.</span><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/changing_climates_microsoft_google.php" class="permalink" rel="bookmark" title="Changing Climates for Microsoft and Google, Desktops and Webs"><br />

<p><a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/">This blog</a> contains tons of interesting information about Mail app functionality. Very interesting (if you have Mac).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.librarything.com/">Library thing</a> is fascinating site about books - it <span class="b">searches Amazon, the Library of Congress and 60 other world libraries and allows browse informations about books, authors , organizing books, making your own collections and following suggestions - "if you liked this book, you may like these as well" type of thing. A very nice idea are also "<a href="http://www.librarything.com/unsuggester/8340">unsuggestions</a>" - if you liked X you will hate Y. For example, if you liked <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography/dp/0385495323/sr=8-1/qid=1165712738/ref=pd_ka_1/701-5325836-2017919?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">"The code book"</a> by Simon Singh (as I certainly did), you will hate <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/4677">The Pilots Wife</a> and about 25 other books. Cannot confirm - I have not read any of them :-)</span></p>
