<p>There is great site <a href="http://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/" target="_self">10 minute mail</a> - which does exactly what it says. Provides you an email address that lives for 10 minutes and then evaporates. For this 10 minutes, you can read any email sent to it on the web page - and eventually renew it for another 10 minutes. Great way how to beat spammers and other email address collecting sites ...</p>
<p>Here is how it looks like.</p>

<p>Site like this obviously needs to live on advertisement. Do you see the irony ? What it offers is actually spamming tool. Now I am not sure whether this is a proof of deep insight or stupidity on advertiser side - or a sign of good sense of humor on the side of the OneMinute Email host :-)</p>
