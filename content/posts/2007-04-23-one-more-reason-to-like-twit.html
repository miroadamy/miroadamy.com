<p>As it happens, both my most favorite podcasters - <a href="http://leoville.com/" target="_blank">Leo Laporte</a> as well as <a href="http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm" target="_blank">Steve Gibson</a> are passionate e-book readers. They have both purchased and are (mostly) happy users of the <a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/" target="_blank">Sony PRS-500</a> aka Sony Reader in addition to several other platforms - (Palm, Pocket PC). In the latest podcasts - both in TWIT as well as Security Now!, the eBooks and eReader got quite some publicity :-).</p>
<p>Both had similar experience with PDF format on PRS-500 as myself - but Steve mentioned the PDF re-flowing the document to make it better suites for small screen - something I have looked into but did not get it working quite right. The preferred approach to using Reader is RTF format - which again, matches my impressions.</p>
<p>Nice discovery was that some independent sources - other than Sony store - are offering ebooks in LRF format. As an example see <a href="http://www.scifi-az.com/" target="_blank">McCollumâ€™s books</a> - a hardcore, scientific sci-fi (no dwarves, elves, spells and dragons here :-)). Thanks for tips, gentlemen - I have added McCollum to my reading list.</p>
