I did quick 2 week visit to Canada.

I spent some time with our son and daughter-in-law, visited many dear friends and places in the city and nature, worked for couple of days in the office and met new colleagues and even met current my boss for the first time in 3D. I must say, he is taller than in Zoom :-D

I also visited our ex-cat with her new human servants and as expected, Lucy duly ignored me. Oh, well - cats.

Gabo gave me a ride in Tesla and as weather cooperated, I could do a few walkabouts and even catch the Tulip Festival with Peter.

It was great to be back.

Here are some pictures:
