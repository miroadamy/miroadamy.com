<p>Since R&amp;K published the <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/" title="The C Programming Language, Second Edition">The Book</a>, the title above became de-facto standard way how to start anything. Which is one of the two reasons why I used it as title for this very first entry. The second reason is that the friendly folks from to <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> have created the title and the first blog entry for me.</p>
