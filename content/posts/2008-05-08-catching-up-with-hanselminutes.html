<p>Thanks to great weather, the walking season is in full progress :-) and that means I was able to add some more listening material to my podcast collection. I still keep track with all part of TWIT network - <a href="http://twit.tv/twit" target="_blank">This week in tech</a>, <a href="http://twit.tv/sn" target="_blank">Security Now!</a>, <a href="http://twit.tv/mbw" target="_blank">MacBreak Weekly</a> and <a href="http://twit.tv/ww" target="_blank">Windows Weekly</a> - but that is nowhere close enough for both walking and driving ...</p>
<p>I have returned back to listening to Scott Hanselman blog (Hanselminutes) - mostly out of curiosity how did working for Microsoft change is very balanced and realistic view of technologies.</p>
<p>Fortunately - it did not.</p>
<p>Scott is still same great, very open minded developer that can see value and strength as well as issues and problems in technology regardless of its origin. It speaks a lot positives about Microsoft as well - by allowing this to happen.</p>
<p>Very good episodes are (back from 2007) from my personal point of view were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=109" target="_self">Eclipse with Bjorn Freeman-Benson</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=108" target="_blank">Software Architecture with Dan Appleman</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=113" target="_blank">2007 The Year in Review</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=117" target="_blank">What's it like for Mac Developers - Interview with Steven Frank of Panic</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I was pretty intrigued with the title of the episode "The Worst Show Ever with Chris Sells and Rory Blyth" - which is <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=112" target="_blank">Episode 112</a> and I have to agree, the title was pretty descriptive :-) - but it was at least reasonably funny.</p>
<p>I am looking forward catching up with rest of the year, which according the <a href="http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/CAON0512" target="_blank">Weather Network</a> should not take too long.</p>
<p>Thanks, Scott. Keep up the great content coming.</p>
