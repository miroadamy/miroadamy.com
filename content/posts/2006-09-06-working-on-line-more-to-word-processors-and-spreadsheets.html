<p><a href="http://members.axion.net/%7Ebbyfield">Bruce Byfield</a> has interesting article in Linux.com featuring <a href="http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/08/28/1619220&amp;from=rss">hands-on comparison of four on-line wordprocessors</a>: specifically  <a href="http://www.ajaxlaunch.com/ajaxwrite/">ajaxWrite</a>, <a href="http://www.thinkfree.com/">ThinkFree Online</a>, <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a>, and <a href="http://www.zohowriter.com/">Zoho Writer</a>. I do not 100% agree with all his conclusions, but it's interesting and worth reading if you are exploring these tools. I am certainly staying with Writely, right now I am using it on daily basis. Combination of <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom">WriteRoom</a> for off-line concepts and "thinking phase" of writing and Writely for on-line editing, adding links, etc fits ideally my needs.</p>
<p>Regarding spreadsheets, <a href="http://www.xcellery.com./About.aspx">Excellery</a> seems to be addressing the shared pain of all on-line spreadsheet - which is need for connectivity. They claim that you can work on-line or off-line and synchronize. Sounds pretty good - I'll give it a try !</p>
<p><a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2006/09/07/sorting-online-spreadsheets-from-a-z/">This article</a> in Web Worker Daily talks about on-line spreadsheets as well as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/09/07/web-based-resources-cx_bn_0907smallbizresource_5.html">Forbes</a> - which happens to nominate (my favorite) Google on-line spreadsheet to be the winner !</p>
<p>Good choice, guys !</p>
