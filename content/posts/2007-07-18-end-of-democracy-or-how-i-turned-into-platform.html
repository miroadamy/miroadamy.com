<p>Once upon a time, there was an application named  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Player" target="_blank">Democracy Player</a>.  A really neat one, capable of downloading videos from internet and playing them in multiple formats. It even can download YouTube videos.</p>
<p>For some reason, the Democracy Player name was replaced with a new name. My name. The Democracy Player will be know as Miro. I have not discovered why this name was chosen, or if it means something. Maybe the guys responsible for it had similar thoughts as my parents over 40 years ago :-).</p>
<p>It is kind of strange feeling to share the name with piece of software. I am not alone - for example one very famous golfer shares the first name with an operating system. A very likely greatest golfer sharing name with very likely greatest operating system :-). But as we know, after Tiger comes Leopard - so the match will soon be over, unless Mr. Woods would consider a name change :-). I guess Leopard Woods does not sound anywhere as good as Tiger, but certainly better than Vista Woods ....</p>
<p>In all this, I am very thankful that the application I share my name with is a good and decent one. Free. Open Source. Runs on Windows and Linux and Mac.  Can even play HD content (free one). I guess I could end up much worse ...</p>
<p>So if you are interested in free, opensource, multi-platform video player, go and <a href="http://www.getmiro.com/" target="_blank">get Miro</a>. The other one :-). I will do the same and I will maybe even join Miro mailing list and become Miro member :-).</p>
