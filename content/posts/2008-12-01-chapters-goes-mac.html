<p>I have noticed few of this beauties in Kanata Chapters. Nice replacement for the beaten up CRT terminals that used to be around. They somehow looked right and familiar from the distance.</p>

<p>Beautiful screen, with touch capability.</p>
<p>Nice presentation and user interface.</p>

<p>Proper keyboard simply must have Command key ;-)</p>
<p>PS:I am sorry for bad quality of pictures - iPhone camera under bad light conditions...</p>
