<p>as long as you are Safari Books online subscriber - see it <a href="http://search.safaribooksonline.com/9780321562739/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Completely updated with XCode 3.x and Objective C 2.0. The screenshots even show the iPhone project templates, indicating the XCode 3.1 in some places. So far the only difference against reality I have found is not covering the XIB resource format (which is generated by default) and sticking with NIB. <a href="http://speirs.org/2007/12/05/what-are-xib-files/" target="_blank">This blog entry</a> has good explanation of the difference.</p>
<p>If you are fan of dead tree-ware books, the official publication date is May 2008, so expect it any day :-).</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as of May 4th, the author's web (<a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/products/cocoa1.shtml" target="_blank">The Big Nerd Ranch</a>) does not really advertise its availability (yet)<br />
