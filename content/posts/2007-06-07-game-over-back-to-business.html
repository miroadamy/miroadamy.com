<p>The wild ride is over and the city gets back to normal. I wish we had won the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup" target="_blank">Cup</a>, but - Ducks were playing pretty good and found what worked on our team. Thanks, <a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&amp;page=PlayerDetail&amp;playerId=8460621" target="_blank">Alfie</a> and the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&amp;page=PlayerSearchPage&amp;team=OTT" target="_blank">Sens</a> - for all the great moments. You were fantastic. There will be another season in few months and another chance to bring the cup home.</p>
<p>On the positive side - it is good to have 2-3 more free evenings a week, now - when there is again nothing on the TV :-). Time  to start catching up with neglected podcasts, blogs and feeds.</p>
