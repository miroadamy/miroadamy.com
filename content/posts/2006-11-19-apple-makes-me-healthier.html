<p>Not only apple the fruit, but also Apple the company. How does it work ?</p>
<blockquote><p>Step 1: Buy an iPod. Any model will do, I have got Nano 2Gen, 4 GB</p>
<p>Step 2: Subscribe to some good podcasts</p>
<p>Step 3: Listen to a podcasts while taking long walks - outdoors (preferred) or in a fittness studio.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's it. It works great for me. During last four weeks I have digested lots of podcasts, inclusive <a href="http://www.twit.tv/">TWIT </a>(This Week In Tech) netcasts  from August 2006 almost up to today.  It is a great way how to stay informed and get more interesting news while spending less time in front of the computer. And on top of that, you can have fun along the way. <a href="http://leoville.com/">Leo Laporte</a> is great host and personalities like <a href="http://dvorak.org/blog/">John C Dvorak</a> add lot's of flavor to the discussion. Few items from latest edition:</p>

<p>I was was really surprised how many interesting podcasts exists out there. Many more than I have time to listen - it is hard to find more than 7-8 hours a week for listening and walking ...</p>
<p>Great source of podcasts are podcast directories - such as <a href="http://www.podcast.net/">http://www.podcast.net/</a>,   <a href="http://www.podcastdirectory.com/">http://www.podcastdirectory.com/</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/podcasts.html">http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/podcasts.html</a>,  <a href="http://www.podcastdirectory.com/"></a><a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/">http://podcasts.yahoo.com/</a> and many others.</p>
<p>In case the podcast are not enough, try audio books - I have listened (during spring and summer) to all books from Ender series by Orson Scott Card and it was fantastic experience. It takes lot's of walking, though if you want to listen unabridged versions (typically 8-20 CD's per book). Recently, Ottawa Public Library started to provide audiobooks as electronic - unfortunately, the DRM is incompatible with iPod's so I will either have to get some cheapo MP3 player just for these books or stay with borrowing and ripping CD's with iTunes...</p>
<p>May the TWIT be with you ... and happy walking.</p>
