# Cybersource Testing Tool

Java utility that we used before when we were debugging the TLS 1.2 issues.

It needs to be compiled with JDK 1.8 - ideally the same one that runs in production and then run like:

```
java -Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake:verbose SSLPoke api.cybersource.com 443
```

replace api.cybersource.com with whatever the cybersource endpoint needs to be.

If the utility responds with 'Successfully connectedâ€™, it was able to handshake with the SSL server and establish the secure connection.

```
javac SSLPoke
java -Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake:verbose SSLPoke api.cybersource.com 443
```
