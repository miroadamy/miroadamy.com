<p>It is a sad news - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut" target="_blank">Kurt Vonnegut Jr.</a>, one of the great sci-fi writers, died at the age of 84.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the great hours spent reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_writings_of_Kurt_Vonnegut" target="_blank">many of great books</a> he wrote over last 55 years. I guess that best way how to show respect is re-read something he wrote - like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-five" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>
