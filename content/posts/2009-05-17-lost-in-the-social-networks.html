<p>This is public answer to all who were asking why is my blog so badly neglected. Short answer is: It is because I am pretty active elsewhere and did not really find any additional time to allocate. If you are busy person, now you know, see ya later. If you are curious what elsewhere means, read on.</p>
<p>Last year and before, blogosphere and this blog was *only* part of the social networking space I was paying attention to. Since about 3-4 months I started to really pay attention to Facebook. I originally joined to find out what my son and couple of friends are up to and somehow I started to see value in this channel of communication. Recently, even my nephews and children of a very good friend that moved from Ottawa to Europe.  So Facebook became the "generation bridge" and channel for stuff out of workspace.</p>
<p>With iPhoto'09 excellent Web integration plugin it is so easy to share picture that I could not resists and uploaded couple of albums :-) - like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=23563&amp;id=1052904780&amp;l=98b6738f33" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>
<p>About month ago, I fell for Twitter. I had account on Twitter for several months, but did not really get it. Actually I pretty much hated Twitter being to most discussed topic on Twit. It was actually <a href="http://twitter.com/naelshawwa" target="_blank">one of our owns - Nael</a> - that caused</p>
<p>me to reconsider, and I am glad I did.  Speaking of Nael - if you are interested in social networks from developer's point of view, SEO and location based services, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/naelshawwa" target="_blank">Nael</a> on Twitter. He also runs <a href="http://elshawwa.blogspot.com/">very good blog</a>.</p>
<p>Again, Twitter is excellent addition - it covers the niche that is too low level or too short lived to be Facebook Worthy. With clients like TweetDeck I can even update both Facebook and Twitter, if I decide to do so. Different people use it for different purposes, for me it is replacement for news and RSS, filtered by the people I have selected combined with (filtered) lifestream log of events and ideas.</p>
<p>For the stuff that is really work related, we have two additional social network and collaboration tools, that limited to the company employees. One is <a href="https://www.yammer.com/home" target="_blank">Yammer</a> - a private version of Twitter with very nice UI. Second is Wiki - we use Atlassian's excellent product <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/" target="_self">Confluence</a>. This is location for everything that is either client confidential, covered by NDA or has intellectual property value. As it happens, lots of information, e.g. related to ATG development goes through and ends up in these channels.</p>
<p>I have also reluctantly returned back to log on into MSN Messenger and Skype. I generally find them quite disruptive and leave them off unless I have a immediate need to communicate. Which I do. The project I am working on has contributors all over the place - Toronto, Halifax, Cape Breton, Ottawa - and MSN is the "bloodline" of the project communication.</p>
<p>So if you want to keep in touch, do not rely solely on blog. You can see me on Facebook (search for Miro Adamy). If somebody I never heard of sends me a friend request I often ignore it, but if you mention blog, I will not. Or you can follow me on Twitter - the nick is <a href="http://twitter.com/miroadamy" target="_self">miroadamy</a>. For that you do not even need permission :-).</p>
<p>The only way how to follow me on Yammer, you must join <a href="http://pub5.thinkwrap.com/home">ThinkWrap Solutions</a> :-). The good news is that we may be needing just somebody like you - there are couple of really interesting projects starting soon, and besides, we are always looking for great people. Send resume to careers at thinkwrap dot com and you will hear back from us.</p>
<p>Please note - no overseas or teleworking and no agencies - you must be legally able to work in Canada and live either in Ottawa or Toronto (Mississauga).</p>
