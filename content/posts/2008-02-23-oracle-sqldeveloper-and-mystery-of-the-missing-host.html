<p>If you work with Oracle database, a very good tool you should not ignore is the Oracle SQL Developer. It gives you much more power when it comes to manipulating data or managing database. I use most of the time MyEclipseIDE plugins, but when I need e.g. export data, the SQLDeveloper is way to go.</p>
<p>Today I tried it for first time on the Mac. I started to configure and database connection and was completely confused by the error message "Port must contain numerical value". Here was the dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/picture-6Q.png" alt="picture-6Q.png" /></p>
<p>I typed  the hostname:1521 but the error message kept coming back. There was no obvious way how to put 3 values - host, port and SID into two field. After checking the documentation, I remembered that the Windows version did have 3 text fields instead of two.</p>
<p>What was the problem ? The layout manager in Java did unfortunately completely hide one of the 3 fields. After resizing the dialog, all fields would be visible:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/picture-4Q.png" alt="picture-4Q.png" /></p>
<p>After this, everything worked OK.</p>
<p>Obviously, Mac version of the SQLDeveloper could use some minor improvement. For example, the menu looks everything but like a finished Mac application:</p>
