<p>It is Friday again, time to clean up the link cache. I'll try to make this a Friday affair and stick with weekly schedule.</p>
<p>The DRM is having hard time: after <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Steve Jobs article about how DRM is bad</a>, EMI announcement of <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/1668/125/" target="_blank">considering dropping the DRM</a>, another of Net celebrities - cryptography legend Bruce Schneier (of Applied Crypography and Blowfish fame) wrote an article for Forbes <a href="http://www.forbes.com/security/2007/02/10/microsoft-vista-drm-tech-security-cz_bs_0212vista.html" target="_blank">Why Vista DRM Is Bad for you</a>. He makes several good points, it is good read.</p>
<p>Interesting article on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-powered-office-tools-discussion/web/a-google-powered-office" target="_blank">using Google as office platform</a> - beyond Google for domains. Do you know what are the 3 largest databases of the world? Not Google, it is actually #4. Its World Data Centre for climate, followed by National Energy Research Centre and AT&amp;T. Hard to believe ? Here you find <a href="http://www.businessintelligencelowdown.com/2007/02/top_10_largest_.html" target="_blank">top ten</a>.</p>
<p>In the .NET world - Scott Hanselman has interesting article on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExitingTheZoneOfPainStaticAnalysisWithNDepend.aspx" target="_blank">Static Code analysis with NDepend</a>. Few interesting findings from CodeProject: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/LisRecordVersioning.asp">Record Versioning with SQL Server</a>, Marc Clifton has new article on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/oca.asp" target="_blank">Disconnected Client Architecture</a> (Marc writes great advanced level articles, look around), <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/showcase/RedGate_SelfDocDatabase.asp">How to use extended properties to create self-documenting databases</a>. Nice <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/A_Gauge.asp" target="_blank">gauge controls</a> for Winforms.</p>
<p>On Mac side: yet another <a href="http://pbgalvin.wordpress.com/the-best-mac-os-resources/" target="_blank">list of best Mac resources</a>. Rant about <a href="http://importantshock.wordpress.com/2007/02/15/quartz-confuser/" target="_blank">Quartz Composer</a>. Release Candidate 3 of Parallels <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/02/15/parallels-desktop-for-mac-release-candidate-3/">is out</a> and it is Leopard ready (to run under Leopard, not to virtualize OS-X). Even Second Life already <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/" target="_blank">has Apple Store</a>. Why does not Ottawa have one ?</p>
<p>From a business law world - for newbies like myself, nice and understandable explanation of the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/business_law/2005/10/going_public_th.html">difference between an IPO and reverse merger through a public shell</a>.Â  Nice video on <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2007/02/google_master_plan_movie.html" target="_blank">Google master plan</a>.</p>
