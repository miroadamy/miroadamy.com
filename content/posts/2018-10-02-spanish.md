It's been five years since I started toying with idea to learn first romance language in my collection - despite living in Canada for over 18 years, I never picked up French.

The learning was slow during 2014 and 2015 (just summer school in Spain and Duolingo) - but it accelerated a lot in last 2 years.

Fast forward to now: on Sunday while watching Prime (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(film)) we have decided to switch from English to Spanish (with Spanish subtitles) to enjoy the movie better than in original.

Misi√≥n (casi) cumplida :-)

Nunca es demasiado tarde para comenzar algo nuevo.
