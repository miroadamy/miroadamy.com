<p>Time to clean up the link cache again. I did not surfed much during last two weekends, so there is less to clean than usual :-).</p>
<p>If your computers are still confused about the DST change, here are some links that may be useful dealing with the issues - for <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/clock/update-your-pc-for-the-new-daylight-saving-time-237803.php" target="_blank">Windows</a> as well as for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/03/08/the-comprehensive-daylight-saving-time-guide-for-your-mac" target="_blank">Mac</a>. Speaking of which, I just checked that my Fedora Core 6 Linux-based NAS did recognized  the DST without any issues at all as well.</p>
<p>For Gmail users with multiple accounts: check out <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1320/" target="_blank">this Firefox extension</a>  to displays email notifications. If you use Google calendar, there is <a href="http://www.daveswebsite.com/software/gsync/" target="_blank">another way</a> how to synchronize with Outlook (should work with Outlook 2003 as well).</p>
<p>This site was recommended on Lifehacker to be a good resource for finding out whether the unknown process you have just seen in process list on Windows is a spyware or just some obscure undocumented system service: <a href="http://www.tasklist.org/tasklist_p.html" target="_blank">tasklist.org</a>. Be aware, though - some of the advices may not be so great. For example, alg.exe is listed as trojan, however there is a system component with the same file name - Application Layer Gateway Service.</p>
<p>This website provides <a href="http://www.arachnoid.com/ruby/index.html" target="_blank">good introduction</a> to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>. Ruby is interesting alternative to Python if you hate whitespace-is-significant type of formatting and still want the dynamic, functional programming language. Or if you want to find out what is the new Everything-On-Rails all about. If you are on the Mac, it is easy to try it out - open terminal window and type 'ruby -v' :-).</p>
<p><a href="http://future.iftf.org/" target="_blank">IFTF</a> blog - link collections focused on particular topic. Nice explanation <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/2A351C60-A4E5-4764-A083-FF8610E66A46.html" target="_blank">how the Apple DRM works</a>.</p>
<p>Few noteworthy applications I have stumbled upon:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.polyglot3000.com/screens.shtml" target="_blank">Polyglot</a> -  tries to identify the (human) language based on fragment of text. Supports over 400 languages (Windows only). Google published version 5.0 of the <a href="http://desktop.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Desktop</a>. Looks very much like Vista.   The <a href="http://www.iconus.ch/fabien/pdflab/" target="_blank">PDFLab </a>- nice free tool to split/merge the PDF files or to convert the sequence of JPG's to PDF (OS-X).   iTunes 7.1 is out (for both Mac and Windows). Interesting file sharing application working as Firefox extension <a href="http://developer.allpeers.com/#welcome" target="_blank">AllPeers </a>went opensource.</p>
