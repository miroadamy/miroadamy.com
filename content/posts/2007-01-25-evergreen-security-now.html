<p>I have started to listen the Security Now! podcasts from the very beginning - sometimes in summer 2005. Unlike someÂ  news-and-rumours podcasts that sound kind of weird if you listen them month later, this one did not loose a bit of it's freshness. Even listening the story of Sony Rootkit discovery again was very entertaining. I am now at first "mod-4" Q&amp;A podcast, Number 16.</p>
<p>Every time I listen to Steve Gibson, one of two things happens. Either I learn something new, or I discover new, better way how to explain something I knew about in a very nice, accessible way. Steve's handling of differences  between WEP and WPA, explanation why MAC address filtering gives no security and his VPN coverage was an excellent example of the later.</p>
<p>On the NAS building front: I have decided to go with 4 SATA + 1 IDE configuration and keep all 4 SATA disks fully RAID-5-ed. I have not yet decided which distribution I will put on. Probably will start with OpenFiler, but Ubuntu looks pretty good too and deservers a try. Btw, Peter is trying to convince me to use BIOS RAID and build a Windows 2003 server - but that is still a Plan B. If time permits, will move the yardstick on Saturday night. It may be delayed, because the biometric security project is quickly approaching the release phase and - as usual - time will be a precious resource.</p>
