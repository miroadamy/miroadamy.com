<p>Few nuggets from recent surfing and reading newsfeeds:</p>
<p>A very nice explanation of differences between Ruby Gem and Rails plugin in <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arungupta/archive/2007/09/totd_6_differen.html" target="_blank">Arun Gupta's blog</a></p>
<p>The community seems to be still fairly divided on the "Is Vista good or bad" ? For the laters, read the <a href="http://darkbrownhole.blogspot.com/2007/02/42-hours-of-vista.html" target="_blank">story</a> from the corporate IT point of view. I still have not  found any  good reason to upgrade :-).<br />
Good story of how the experience of joining a project <a href="http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/home" target="_blank">should not look like</a></p>
<p>Good discussion on <a href="http://www.bitwisemag.com/2/Flex-the-road-to-Web-3" target="_blank">Flex, Flash</a></p>
<p>Long but interesting blogpost on <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html" target="_blank">ontology</a></p>
<p>MySQL <a href="http://www.angryhacker.com/blog/archive/2007/09/16/mysql-eye-for-an-microsoft-sql-server-guy.aspx" target="_blank">seen from the point of view</a> of experienced SQL Server user</p>
<p>Some news from the GooglePlex: everybody seems to notice that Google added the presentations to spreadsheets and documents, so you have now complete simple but functional replacements of the Word, Excel and Powerpoint for free. Google also stepped again into territory of social bookmarking - after Google <a href="http://www.google.com/bookmarks/" target="_blank">bookmarks</a> they are launching <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/09/google-shared-stuff.html" target="_blank">Shared Stuff</a>. The news I personally liked the most isÂ  <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/google-launches-javascript-api-that-allows-you-to-write-back" target="_blank">writeable API to GData.</a></p>
<p>Listing of hundred <a href="http://www.mkbergman.com/?page_id=325" target="_blank">tools for Semantic Web</a></p>
