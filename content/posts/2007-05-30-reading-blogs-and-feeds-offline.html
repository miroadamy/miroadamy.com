<p>It happened! After starting my preferred feed aggregator - Google Reader I have noticed the new feature that sounded so good that I almost could not believe it: offline reading. Using new plugin - Google Gears, the reader can cache 2000 items locally and allows you to go offline and read the news, blogs or whatever you have subscribed to absolutely anywhere.</p>
<p>The installation starts with this screen:</p>
<p><a href="/images/screen-10.png" title="screen-10.png"><img src="/images/screen-10.png" alt="screen-10.png"  width="400" /></a></p>
<p>and goes on with this:</p>
<p><a href="/images/screen-11.png" title="screen-11.png"><img src="/images/screen-11.png" alt="screen-11.png" /></a></p>
<p>After browser restart, all magic is hidden under small greenish button next to Settings:</p>
<p><a href="/images/screen-12.png" title="screen-12.png"><img src="/images/screen-12.png" alt="screen-12.png" /></a></p>
<p>Pressing the button downloads the 2000 items. The download is very fast, on cable modem it takes about 10-15 seconds.</p>
<p><a href="/images/screen-13.png" title="screen-13.png"><img src="/images/screen-13.png" alt="screen-13.png" /></a></p>
<p>After download, you can disconnect the cable, switch off the wireless - or whatever you do - and take your latest and greatest blogs and news wherever you want. Here is the link to the <a href="//googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/05/oh-sam-i-am-can-i-read-it-on-tram.html" target="_blank">"official" blog announcement</a>.<br />
Thanks, Google - this is great feature !</p>
