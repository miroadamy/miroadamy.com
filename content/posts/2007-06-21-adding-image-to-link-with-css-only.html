<p>As seen in the video at <a href="http://sciencehack.com/videos/view/IDT2RMJNvSA#searchkeywords" target="_blank">http://sciencehack.com/videos/view/IDT2RMJNvSA#searchkeywords</a></p>
<p>The source code:</p>
<p><a href="/images/screen-16.png" title="screen-16.png"><img src="/images/screen-16.png" alt="screen-16.png" /></a></p>
<p>Very good explanation is in the video mentioned above. So far so good - unfortunately the technique, however cool it is, does seem to work in Firefox only. Or at least it does not work in the still most prevalent browser on the Net.</p>
<p>Here is how it renders (properly) in Firefox (tested with 1.5)</p>
<p><a href="/images/screen-14.png" title="screen-14.png"><img src="/images/screen-14.png" alt="screen-14.png" /></a></p>
<p>and here is how it looks in IE7:</p>
<p><a href="/images/screen-15.png" title="screen-15.png"><img src="/images/screen-15.png" alt="screen-15.png" /></a></p>
