<p>The support for using dynamic languages such as Ruby or Python to code ASP.NET pages was announced for future versions of ASP.NET in the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/05/21/asp-net-futures-may-2007.aspx" target="_blank">ASP.NET futures.</a></p>
<p>Unless I am mistaken, it means that we eventually will be able to write control event handlers in Python or even Ruby - which is certainly more fun than in VB.NET or even in C#, but is it really so important ?</p>
<p>What would be *really* cool if the whole ASP.NET become more agile and more "rail-ish".  To make overall architecture more flexible - such as departure from not very flexible page-centric architecture towards MVC and routing. Maybe some version of ActiveRecord ? Or even multiple (and pluggable) template languages ? That would be really something.</p>
