<p>For Jack, Manju and Michel: here is the poem we talked about.</p>
<p><em>Eye have a spelling chequer<br />
It came with my pea sea<br />
It plainly marques four my revue<br />
Miss steaks eye kin knot sea.</em></p>
<p><em>Eye strike a key and type a word<br />
And weight four it two say<br />
Weather eye am wrong oar write<br />
It shows me strait a weigh.</em></p>
<p><em>As soon as a mist ache is maid<br />
It nose bee fore two long<br />
And eye can put the error rite<br />
Its rare lea ever wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>Eye have run this poem threw it<br />
I am shore your pleased two no<br />
Its letter perfect awl the weigh<br />
My chequer tolled me sew.</em></p>
