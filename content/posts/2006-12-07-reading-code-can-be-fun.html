<p>I have switched away from using Outlook once again for variety of reasons - as part of my latest attempts to reduce complexity and increase security (more on that later) and went back to Thunderbird/Web based email systems on all Windows machines. Conversion of address books was piece of cake this time, thanks to <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a>  which I use to synchronize Mac and Windows based systems. Nonetheless, I got curious what format does Thunderbird use for address book and this way I have discovered the awkward <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mork_%28file_format%29">Mork file format</a>.</p>
<p>Typical way how to process this is using Perl or Python.  <a href="http://www.jwz.org/">Jamie Zawinski</a> wrote one of the scripts in Perl. I normally do not consider reading Perl code to be my favorite leisure time activity (we all know that Perl is write-only language), but this time I did peek in. Here is pure jewel I have discovered inside:</p>

</a></p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.jwz.org/hacks/mork.pl">whole script</a>. 

Who said that reading Perl script cannot be fun ?</p>
<p>Btw, if you are using Windows (which does not have the wonderful snapshot capabilities of Command-Shift-3/Command-Shift-4 keys), you may find <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/brian/articles/Cropper.aspx">Cropper </a>very useful.  It is free, opensource and works like charm. Requires .NET framework, but that's pretty much everywhere. Enjoy</p>
