<p>From today's Steve Jobs' keynote at Macworld 2007:</p>
<p><strong>"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been. "<br />
</strong><em>Wayne Gretzky</em></p>
<p>I guess everybody is going to write about iPhone - which is OK because it is indeed very interesting gadget and it stole the show. To bad it will be 6 more months until it will be available in the US and (my best hopes) 8-9 months to have it here in Canada.</p>
<p>Three  other things what I secretly hoped that will be announced:</p>
<p>1) a date when Leopard will be out (I kind of hoped it will be out when Vista hits the streets) and more details on features<br />
2) announcement that Mac Pro will be upgraded to dual-quadcore CPU. Would not it be great to have machine with 8 cores, 8 GB RAM and 2 TB diskspace ?<br />
3) ultra-light 10-11" notebook with speech and writing recognition</p>
<p>I guess we'll have to wait ...</p>
<p>But it was better than a movie. Great show, Mr. Jobs.</p>
