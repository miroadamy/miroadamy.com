<p>Actually, maybe not really new, but I have noticed it just two days ago while trying to to clean up the clips collected from the Web.</p>
<p>It is sort of hidden feature, but very useful one: In Actions you can find 'Export in Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheet'. It takes the current notebook and makes it a new document in you Google Docs. All texts, including pictures are transferred. It does very good job in keeping meaningful structure of the newly created document: every note will become an URL heading in document, pointing to the original.</p>
<p>Why I think this is so useful: with exporting doc, you get much better editing capabilities and also ability of collaboration (shared editing) with your friends. You will also get easy way how to transfer the notes into formats suitable for offline reading/backup: HTML/RTF/PDF/Word/Open Office.</p>
