<p><em>The realization came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own programs.</em></p>
<p>-- Maurice Wilkes</p>
<p>What is so worthy mentioning on this obvious stament, describing fate likely shared by many thousand or milions of software developers worldwide ? Not much, only the date. According <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/" target="_blank">this book</a> (which is a pretty good read btw),<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Vincent_Wilkes" target="_blank">Sir Maurice</a> came to the sad realization mentioned above in the year <strong>1949</strong>.</p>
<p>Just wondering - what have we learned since ?</p>
