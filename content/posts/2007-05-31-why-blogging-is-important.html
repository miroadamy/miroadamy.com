<p>Joel Oleson is suffering if you do not blog ! Sounds strange ? Read the article <strong><em>Join the SharePoint Blogging Revolution!</em></strong><br />

<p>He makes several very good points - which have very little to do with Sharepoint - but I think the best one is helping the "organic indexing" of the Web space and helping the search engines out there better rank content.
