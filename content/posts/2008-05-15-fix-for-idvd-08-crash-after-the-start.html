<p>Today I tried for the first time the iDVD 08 with intention to create DVD version of the screencast - just to find out that the application dies right after the start. From the error report (thanks for that) the problem was in missing dependency Oxygene framework - a module similar to Windows DLL. Here is the error message:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language='xml']</p>
<p>Link (dyld) error:</p>
<p>Library not loaded: @executable_path/../Frameworks/Oxygene.framework/Versions/A/Oxygene<br />
Referenced from: /Applications/iDVD.app/Contents/MacOS/iDVD<br />
Reason: image not found</p>
<p>[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>The solutions described in the Apple discussion groups revolved around using shareware tool Pacifist - something I did not like particularly. The plain reinstallation of the DVD did not help either.</p>
<p>What worked for me and solved the problem was complete removal of iDVD and subsequential reinstall. I used AppZapper to remove the application, but it also can be done manually by deleting the application bundle from /Applications, removing all iDVD receipts from /Library/Receipts and all content from ~/Library/iDVD and ~/Library/Preferences (which is in a nutshell all AppZapper did).</p>

<p>Right after removal, insert Installation disk 1, select Install Bundled Software Only, press Customize and uncheck everything except iDVD. The program starts fine after installation finishes.</p>
<p>One more minor hickup after reinstall was that the Theme introduction would not play in preview - all the application showed was black screen with background music. This was resolved by selecting 'Check for updates' and allowing installation of the update. Afterwards, I was able to start working in my first DVD :-).</p>
