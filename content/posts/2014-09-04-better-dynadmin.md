Source of the fix is <https://github.com/jc7447/BetterDynAdmin>. 
This is to capture the installation process and provide backup in case the tool disappears.

The pages generated by DynAdmin are actually not coming from a JSP or JHTML pages. The HTML you see is generated by hardcoded servlets. Each Nucleus component has assigned Admin servet, which is called when DynAdmin is trying to render the page.

The improvent here are user scripts - running inside Firefox or Chrome, utilizing infrastructure provided by Greasemonkey extension (FF) or Tampermonkey (Chrome).

## Installation - Chrome
Download and install Tampermonkey - <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo>

It will show as new icon. Click the icon:

select Add New Script, use the URL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jc7447/bda/master/bda.user.js> (also see bda.user.js local copy attachment)

Make sure that in settings the /dyn/admin is selected - this is what triggers the script run
