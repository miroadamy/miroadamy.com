<p><strong>1960</strong></p>
<p>A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.  His cost of production is 4/5 of this price. What is his profit?</p>
<p><strong>1970 (Traditional)</strong></p>
<p>A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.  His cost of production<br />
is 4/5 of this price, or in other words, $80.  What is his profit?</p>
<p><strong>1970 (New Math)</strong></p>
<p>A logger exchanges a set L of lumber for a set M of money.  The cardinality of set M is 100 and each element is worth a dollar.  Make a square array of 100 dots to represent the elements of set M.  The set C of the cost of production contains 20 fewer elements than set M. Represent set C as a subset of K and answer the following question:<br />
What is the cardinality of set P of profits?</p>
<p><strong>1980</strong></p>
<p>A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.  His cost of production is $80 and his profit is $20.  Your assignment is to underline the number 20.</p>
<p><strong>1990 (Outcomes-based destreamed integrated Math)</strong></p>
<p>By cutting down beautiful forest trees, an environmentally ignorant logger makes a profit of $20.  What do you think of this way of making a living?  In your group, use role play to determine how the forest birds and squirrels feel.</p>
