<p>After long time, I stumbled upon something that is both educational and practical. Since Doug Lea's classic, this is very readworthy work on concurrency in Java world. It focuses on Java 5 features and addresses both Web applications as well as GUI apps - each group having their own share of concurrency related problems</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321349601?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=none0b69&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321349601">Amazon page</a> for the book - check the reviews.  There is also a <a href="http://www.javaconcurrencyinpractice.com/jcip-sample.pdf">sample chapter</a> available on the <a href="http://www.javaconcurrencyinpractice.com/">book's website</a>.
