One day round trip Valencia to Madrid and back.

It is 350 km, but AVE (high velocity train) makes it in 1.5 hr. Take that, Via Rail !!

Travelling at 300 km/h is unreal. It is actually quieter and more smooth than Canadian train at 80 - all that makes the speed believable is the velocity display and view out of the window when train goes around something closer to the rails.

The summit itself - very well organized, good content, great opportunity to practice Spanish. Lots of new ideas and material to process.
