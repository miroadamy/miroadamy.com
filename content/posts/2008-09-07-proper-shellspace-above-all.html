<p>Here is a snapshot I took during today's trip to Chapters @ Rideau. While walking out, the placement of some books caught my eye:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-552" title="img_0567" src="/images/img_0567.jpg?w=450" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>Note the "headlines" in the background of the Vista books: "Ailments and diseases". Certainly unintended and a bit childish, but I found it hilariously funny :-)</p>
