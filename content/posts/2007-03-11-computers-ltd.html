<p>Same as last few weeks, I have spent most of the weekend reading. Unlike the weekends before, this time I was actually reading a book, not source code. It was nice change ...</p>
<p>I have picked this small book with title <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Computers-Ltd-What-They-REALLY/dp/0198505558/ref=sr_1_1/702-4361659-1001631?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1173662117&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Computers Ltd</a> in  Ottawa Public Library last Friday, while returning some books on CD. Written by David Harel of Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, the book is trying to explain what computers cannot do. It speaks about complexity, P / NP problem and other fundamental limitations of what we can and cannot do with our favorite toys. This book is nice proof that even on such complex and abstract problems it is possible to find  very nice and readable presentation - without sacrificing the precision. It reads as novel and thanks to very short format, it is an excellent complement to quiet Sunday afternoon. Recommended.</p>
<p>And speaking of mathematics, here is a way how to tell extroverted mathematician from introverted mathematician (for all you folks interested in M-B classification and similar:</p>
<p><em>The difference between an introvert and extrovert mathematicians is:<br />
An introvert mathematician looks at his shoes while talking to you. An extrovert mathematician looks at your shoes.<br />
</em></p>
