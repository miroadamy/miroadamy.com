<p>Weekend time again. As few times before, here are few discoveries from the Web:</p>
<p>Google is pushing Internet Explorer 7. Their <a href="http://www.google.com/toolbar/ie7/">own version</a>,  using new <em>Internet Explorer Administration Kit. </em>It is not really different version - just configured with Google as default search engine and Google toolbar. Nothing that little more experienced user would not do himself. I am not sure how successfull this will be - but I am pretty sure that this was not what Microsoft had in mind how this tools should be used for.</p>
<p>NY Times offers pretty entertaining series of videos with <a href="http://video.on.nytimes.com/ifr_main.jsp?nsid=b26f34614:10f8d5664f0:7c8a&amp;fr_story=d14603c1e23e6ce37920a8134a2e27b1405a4991&amp;st=1166310924323&amp;mp=FLV&amp;cpf=false&amp;fvn=8&amp;fr=121606_110117_26f34614x10f8bf8e912xw6d6a&amp;rdm=750772.2597379374">David Pogue</a>. Over forty pieces, several of them are relly funny.</p>
<p>Guess which country has most IP adresses per capita ? No, neither USA, nor Japan, nor the Scandinavian countries, it is Vatican. USA is second, Canada third (thumbs up !!). More countries are <a href="http://www.modernlifeisrubbish.co.uk/article/ips-assigned-per-capita">here</a>. No surprises on the other side of the scale: Ethiopia, Niger, Congo.</p>
<p>Interesting article how <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/googlife">Google keeps employees</a>: by treating them like kids. Very interesting. Should I have had an option at the time of finishing my university studies, to extend my student life by few more years - I would have likely gone for it. I even tried it by accepting a job at the University, but it was not the same. Obvious why - different time and no Google ...</p>
<p><strong>Few blogs that caught my attention:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://mirkwood.wordpress.com/">Mirkwood</a> - blog about reading. See also the recommended links on similar blogs ...</p>
<p><a href="http://innerdaemon.wordpress.com/">Sharing the truth one thread at the time</a>. - despite  the religiously sounding  title, this one is about technology. Interesting reads.</p>
<p>This one is classic: Merlin Mann's <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/googlife">43folders</a> Check it out if you do not know it. I mention it because I listened to few Merlin's <a href="http://www.43folders.com/podcast/">podcasts</a> and liked them. Worth looking at is also <a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Main_Page">Wiki</a> and <a href="http://board.43folders.com/">forum</a>.<a href="http://www.43folders.com/podcast/"><br />
