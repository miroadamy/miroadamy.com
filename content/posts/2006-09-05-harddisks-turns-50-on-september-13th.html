<p>It is hard to imagine - on September 13th it will be 50 years since IBM introduced the very first hard drive.</p>
<p>Since that time technology made quite a progress. Compare for yourself:</p>
<p><b>1956 - RAMAC drive</b></p>
<ul>
<li>capacity: 5 Megabytes, built from fifty 24" spinning disks</li>
<li>weight: about one ton</li>
<li>price: $250'000 / year (lease)</li>
<li>price per gigabyte: about fifty million dollars</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2006 - typical harddrive</b></p>
<ul>
<li>capacity: 500 GB</li>
<li>weight: &lt; 1kg</li>
<li>price: ~ $300</li>
<li>price per gigabyte: about 60 cents</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazing, isn't it ?</p>
