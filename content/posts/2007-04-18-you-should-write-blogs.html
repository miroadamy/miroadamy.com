<p><em><strong>YOU should write blogs</strong>. </em></p>
<p><em>Even if nobody reads them, you should write them. It's become pretty clear to  me that blogging is a source of both innovation and clarity. I have many of my  best ideas and insights while blogging. Struggling to express things that you're  thinking or feeling helps you understand them better.</em></p>
