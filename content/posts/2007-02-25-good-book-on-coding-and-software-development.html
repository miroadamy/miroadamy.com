<p>I have picked it two days ago in Chapters - <a href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/item/books-978159327119/1593271190/Code-Craft?ref=Search+Books%3a+'Code+craft'" target="_blank">Code Craft</a> by Pete Goodliffe. Somehow similar in topics covered as the Rapid Development or From Coder to Developer - but newer. Divided into 6 parts:</p>
<p>Part I - At the codeface - defensive programming techniques, naming, formatting, commenting, error handling</p>
<p>Part II - The secret life of code - code contruction tools, testing and debugging methods, building</p>
<p>Part III - The Shape of the code - code design, architecture, source code growth and decay over time</p>
<p>Part IV - The Herd of Programmers - development practices and programming skills, psychological aspects of programming, communication</p>
<p>Part V - Part of the Process - rites and rituals of software development, specifications, estimation, code reviews,</p>
<p>Part VI - View from the top - high level view, sofware development metodologies.</p>
<p>I started to read in rather unstructured way in chapter 16 (Code Monkeys) dealing with typology of programmers and chapter 17,Â  covering the team and communication issues. I liked it a lot. Easy read, funny, entertaining and very practical. Often just common sense, but already formulated and properly packaged, ready to be communicated.</p>
<p>I have decided to read the full book. Will post a review after I am done.</p>
