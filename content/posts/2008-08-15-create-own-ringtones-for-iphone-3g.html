<p>One of the many things that I never did before was actually customizing the phone. Neither of the songs that I really liked for ringtone (and were unique enough) were available of course. I found this website: <a href="http://audiko.net/en.html" target="_blank">http://audiko.net/en.html</a> that allows to take an MP3 (one that you legally own, of course) and convert it to ringtone.</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<p>1) Find a suitable MP3</p>
<p>2) Go to above website, upload MP3</p>
<p>3) In editor, select the start and end sequence of the  melody - you can listen to it before you finalize</p>
<p>4) Press 'Create Ringtone' and download it</p>
<p>5) Import to iTunes</p>
<p>Could not be simpler than that.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Uploading MP3 (or even creating them by ripping the CD's) may be illegal in the country you live. I do not recommend or suggest you should do it - I am merely describing a technical process of data transformation and take absolutely no responsibility for any troubles or issues related to that you may get yourself into.</em></p>
