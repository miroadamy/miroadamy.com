<p>One of the most readable, original blogers out there, writing on software development practice and techniques - <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a> - published an excellent 3 part Talk at Yale: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/03.html" target="_blank">Part1</a>, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/04.html" target="_blank">Part2 </a>and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/05.html" target="_blank">Part3</a>.</p>
<p><b>You will find out:</b></p>
<p>- what two computer science courses were most useful in his university studies<br />
(one that was not really a comp-sci and one he decided to drop)<br />
- why is it tough to be an in-house programmer<br />
- why is the quality of many in-house systems so bad<br />
- what is this "quality thing" anyway<br />
- why is specification futile</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>
