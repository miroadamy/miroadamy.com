<p><strong>1) <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/">Bruce Schneier</a></strong></p>
<p>Bruce is author of several excellent books on cryptography, from very easy, thriller like read to a classic work <a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-applied.html">Applied Cryptograhy</a> (highly recommended). The blog goes back to 2004 and is fascinating read.</p>
<p><strong>2) <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/">Paul Thurrott</a></strong></p>
<p>Paul is the Windows guy from <a href="http://www.twit.tv/ww">Windows Weekly</a> podcast (recommended) who also runs the <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/">Winsupersite</a> . He is one of the few people who focus on Microsoft technology and still keep balanced, fair view of the affairs. Paul is certainly not a Microsoft fanboy - and obviously not a Microsoft hater. He seems to share the same balanced approach in case of Apple and OS-X - he appreciates his strengths without being an Apple zealot.</p>
<p><strong>3) <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/default.aspx"></a><a href="http://beust.com/weblog/">Cedrik's Weblog</a></strong></p>
<p>Google engineer, creator of the <a href="http://testng.org/doc/index.html">TestNG</a> framework, writing mostly on Java and test driven development. I was fairly deep involved recently in unit testing (mostly in .NET world) and discovered there is a lot of interesting tools and frameworks available beyond the JUnit/NUnit boundaries. But that is topic for the other time.</p>
