<p>On previous weekend I had great opportunity to spend a lot of time listening to books and podcasts. The opportunity was long drive to Quebec City and back, plus the two days spent walking around with camera, taking pictures, enjoying the differences in style and architecture and listening to <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/" target="_blank">Seth Godin's</a> book - <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/small/">Small is the new big</a>.</p>
<p>There is nothing in this book that would actually require to drive almost 500 km one way - you can comfortably get the same benefit out of it without moving out from your favorite sofa, walking around your neighborhood or on a treadmill (hi Joel). The real reason being in the capitol of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" target="_blank">La Belle Province</a> was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Skate_Canada_International" target="_blank">Skate Canada</a> - Grand Prix competion in figure skating. And while my wife was watching <a href="http://www.jeffbuttle.com/news.php" target="_blank">Jeff Buttle</a>, Joannie Rochette and many others - which is her favorite leisure time activity, I was walking, taking pictures and listening - which is mine.</p>
<p>The book is very well suited for listening while taking pictures. It consists of short comments on large number of topics - business and life related, presented in alphabetical order. This allows to do frequent stops for shots without loosing the context. If you now think that it must be boring to listen something resembling a lexicon you are wrong. Seth is original, often provocative and inconventional, sometimes "common-sensy" obvious, but never boring. I was very surprised how interesting can be a book from an expert in area of marketing - something that I never had any admiration for (or high opinion about). If you are hardcore techie  like me with the same prejudice again something so non-geeky and slippery as marketing, give Seth a chance - you may be surprised.</p>
<p>Recommended.</p>
