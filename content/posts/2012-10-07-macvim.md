OK, NERDTree plugin IS great, but this is awesome.

Alloy made custom version of MacVim with file drawer: see <https://github.com/alloy/macvim/wiki/Building>

It is available in source - so you have to compile it yourselves. But if you do not want to, I did it and the binary is attached, built with these features:

> ./configure --with-feature=huge --enable-rubyinterp --enable-pythoninterp --enable-perlinterp --enable-cscope

Archive is attached: MacVim.zip

If you want to get my set of plugins and customizations, it is on GitHub: - https://github.com/radegast/dotvim,

Documentation files tells it all:

* <https://github.com/radegast/dotvim/blob/master/README.md>
* <https://github.com/radegast/dotvim/blob/master/ModuleInfo.md>
* <https://github.com/radegast/dotvim/blob/master/Versions.md>
