<p>I was holding off for over two weeks, decided not go with that outrageous iPhone voice/data racket. Even trying to encourage people to wait in a hope the demand will be weak and Rogers will bend and lower the rates.</p>
<p>Only, it was not. I mean demand. iPhones seems to be selling better than beaver tales on Dow's Lake during sub minus twenty sunny skating Saturday. Especially the 16 GB ones.</p>
<p>Now it's over. I ordered white 16 GB iPhone yesterday.</p>
<p>It's all Gabo's fault. After playing a bit with the darn thing, I can resist no more. It is after all more than just  iPod touch with more hardware. Four killer features from my very private point of view:</p>
<p>1) GPS with Google maps. So valuable especially now when I spend more time in Montreal than in Ottawa and walk around during evenings and lunch breaks...</p>
<p>2) Internet access. All my stuff is in the cloud - notes, documents, contacts, emails. With 3G or even Edge it is only 1 second and few clicks away. So much faster than getting notebook out of backpack. Not speaking of not needing WiFi to do so - very useful while sitting in the train. Btw, ViaRail, your WiFi is so unusable ....</p>
<p>3) camera that allows taking only slighly bad pictures. Big upgrade from Motorola where pictures were just plain terrible / hardly usable. Getting them off the phone happens automagically and they end up in proper place - iPhoto, without waiting 10 minutes for bluetooth sync ...</p>
<p>4) Address book synchronization. Finally I will be able to dial from same database that is on my Mac - without holding iPod touch in one hand and phone in other, typing in the number I found on Touch. Yes, I did try to sync RAZR with computer. Three times. It consistently failed and wiped out Motorola twice and Address book once (no damage thanks to Time Machine ;-))</p>
<p>All this is worth spending 30 more bucks a month for 6 GB data plan. Gabo discovered it is more than plenty even if you surf a lot and listen to internet radio 2-3 hours a day. I hate the idea giving Rogers more of my money, but, as Tony Soprano  would put it: "What are'ya gonna do ?". Maybe I can find something to cancel to lower the bill - like some cable package. Who needs TV when there is YouTube and Google Video :-).</p>
<p>As added benefit, my daughter is very happy to be getting the Touch really soon now ;-)</p>
<p>And by the way, once for a change talking to the Rogers sales person was quite pleasant experience. Too bad I did not write down her name - but she was really nice. What a change after that groups of obnoxious morons that used to call me regularly to offer HomePhone :-)</p>
