I had an opportunity to attend DockerCon 2018 in person - it was great experience in wonderful city - Barcelona. My notes from it  <a href="{{< relref "2018-12-07-DockerCon-2018.md" >}}">are here</a>. I missed previous year (for variety of reasons), but this year as many other tech events was purely virtual so I was able to see some part of it.

Compared to 2018, the general tone and content of this DockerCon was quite different. In 2018 it felt like all the attention is focused on big enterprise (mainly Microsoft) and what Docker as a company is looking for best way how to hook big firms with deep pockets. 

DockerCon Live was pretty different - not only because it was online event, without booths, party, workshops and crowds. I had the impression that Docker is focusing once again on developers and I did not miss the enterprisey flavour at all.

Here are few of the interesting presentations - full agenda is at [here](https://docker.events.cube365.net/docker/dockercon/agenda)

## The First 10M Pulls: Building the official Curl Image for Docker Hub
by James Fuller: https://docker.events.cube365.net/docker/dockercon/content/Videos/yKyKXvufcho7ZyE4E 

Interesting background information on workflow and lesson learned while maintaining official docker image for one of the most used tools for accessing http endpoints. 

Did you know that curl has around 10 billion deployment ? I did not, neither did I know of curl-configure command. Man lernt nie aus.
