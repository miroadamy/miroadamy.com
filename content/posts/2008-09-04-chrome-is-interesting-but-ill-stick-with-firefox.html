<p>Everybody seems to be crazy about Chrome, the new superfast Google browser. The odes on speed sounded quite exaggerated, so I had to try it. I opened up again my old battered Fujitsu Lifebook and after 3 reboots (it was not used for about 2 months and Windows update had to have its patching done) I downloaded and installed it.</p>
<p>The rumors were not unsubstantiated ... it IS considerably speedierÂ  than anything else, including Opera. I have not seen any issues on the few sites I have tried - everything seems to work just fine.</p>
<p>So why back to Firefox ?</p>
<p>Three reasons. First, Chrome does not exist for Mac or Linux and I am not going to use Windows in VM just to surf web, that would be kinda silly. This will be presumably fixed soon - according to the <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2008/09/platforms-and-priorities.html" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the Firefox extensions are simply too good to be missed. I happily exchange speed for goodness of Firebug.</p>
<p>And third: the IS a catch and many people noticed it. The Google's EULA says:</p>

<p>11.4 You confirm and warrant to Google that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the above license.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a lawyer, but this seems to be little bit too much. Google already has all my emails and knows most about my searches :-( ... but I have no intention transfer to them e.g. ownership of my photos that could upload to Smugmug using their browser. Or similar.</p>
<p>Fortunately most of the components are opensource, and I am certain that the good pieces will make their way to our computers packaged in some alternative open and user friendly speed devil browser. Ideally under Apache or BSD license ;-)</p>
<p>Until that time - by bye Chrome. Uninstalled. And I am <a href="http://blog.andreloker.de/post/2008/09/03/Chrome-didnt-survive-long.aspx" target="_blank">not alone that did so</a> ...</p>
