<p>As I noticed on Apple Website, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/" target="_blank">SDK for developing 3rd party applications for iPhone/Touch</a> will be available in February. This solves the biggest problem - offline reading - because with SDK, storing a downloaded copy will be trivial. It also will most likely fix the annoying lack of updatability of calendar and add few more interesting apps.</p>
<p>It is only matter of time until the other eBook formats will be be readable on iPod - such as CHM or PalmDoc (non-DRM-ed version).</p>
<p>With only 8 days remaining to Leopard and this anouncement, it feels like Christmas is here early this year :-)</p>
