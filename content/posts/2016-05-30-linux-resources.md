This quick summary to answer Megha Maiya's question - I am adding to the Wiki in case it can be expanded later
useful for somebody else:

## Free resources

There is HUGE amount of resources available for Linux and Unix out there. The issue is select those reasonably good 

* List of lists: [https://github.com/learnbyexample/scripting\_course/blob/master/Linux\_curated\_resources.md](https://github.com/learnbyexample/scripting_course/blob/master/Linux_curated_resources.md)
* <http://ryanstutorials.net/>, specially <http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/> and <http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/>
* <http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-getting-started.htm>
* (bash scripting) - [https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Main\_Page](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Main_Page)
* free book - <http://unixmages.com/ufbm.pdf> - very beginner friendly
* list of free books: <http://www.dailyartisan.com/news/open-source-e-books-for-linux/>
* Eli The computer guy - <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD6B6473ACF32C59D> (I like this one)
* YouTube channel - ultimate Linux tutorials - <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn58SGUDUnUHRYKyNffHQrQ>
(from a generous Indian guy sharing his experience with the world for free. Not ideal audio quality, could use some editing - bot has lots of content)
* EDX courses - <https://www.edx.org/school/linuxfoundationx>

* Wikibooks - [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LPI\_Linux\_Certification](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LPI_Linux_Certification)

## Hands On

Reading books and watching videos will have very little impact without trying things out.

I HIGHLY recommend 

* install Virtualbox from Oracle (virtualbox.org)
* either create new virtual machine, download image and install Linux from scratch
  * pick either Centos 6 or Centos 7 distribution
  * or Ubuntu distribution
* or download ready-made VB image - [http://www.osboxes.org/centos-7-image-virtualbox-vmware-available-x86\_64/](http://www.osboxes.org/centos-7-image-virtualbox-vmware-available-x86_64/)

and do a lot of practical exercises. The good free book covering installation is <http://linux-training.be/linuxfun.pdf>

## Paid resources

The advantage is that the content is usually better structured and easier to follow and also usually is targeting a certification exam.

* Linux Academy - $29/month - <https://linuxacademy.com/tour> - leads to certification
* Lynda - <http://www.lynda.com/search?q=Linux>, about $35/month, has 10 day free trial (RECOMMENDED)
* Cloud Academy - focusing more on AWS offering, ~ $50/month - <https://cloudacademy.com/library/>
* Udemy - "pay by course" - <https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?ref=home&src=ukw&q=LInux&lang=en>
* Udacity - <https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595> (some free courses)
* Sitepoint - lots of UI resources but also Linux. Good ebooks as part of membership: [https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/topics/all?q=Linux&limit=24&offset=0&page=1&content\_types[]=All&slugs[]=all&states[]=available&order=]()

## Non-Server side

As we discussed, no level of Linux system experience will help you if the Web app is having client side issues - broken JavaScript - and the request never reaches the server.
