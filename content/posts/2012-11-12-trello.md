Finally a todo/task/project management system that is very good fit.

Here is why:

* is pretty visually
* modern and dynamic UI
* has Web back-end (usable from Linux VM)
* has decent iPhone app
* allows checklists (multiple)
* allows color coding
* Markdown support
* ecosystem

There is Gmello that allows create card from GMail, plus few others that seem to bridge the gap between Evernote, System XYZ and Trello
